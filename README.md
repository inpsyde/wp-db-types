# WP DB types

Some general purpose interfaces on working with databases, focused on WordPress development.

Currently these are:

 * `WpDbTypes\Type\ImmutableArrayAccess`
 * `WpDbTypes\Type\Result`
 * `WpDbTypes\Type\Statement`
 * `WpDbTypes\Type\Table`
 * `WpDbTypes\Type\TableSchema`
 
Roadmap:

 * Versioning 
 * Provide a JSON representation of `TableSchema`
